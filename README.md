This project is still under construction.

It uses MVC architecture and it is programmed in Python with Django as a framework and SQLite as a database for now.

The theme of the site is Ufology and the purpose of it is letting students store tutorials.

When we learn about any topic, we get information everywhere ( websites, videos, links, emails, images, etc.). In this site, students can 
create their own tutorial related to any topic and store all those links and files in a organized way.

The main page of the site will show different topics related to Ufology ( videos, links, information, etc. ).
